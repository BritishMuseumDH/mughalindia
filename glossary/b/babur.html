Babur was the founder of the Mughal Empire. He was born in 1483 and was the ruler of Ferghana by the time he was eleven years old.
<br><br>
 Not satisfied with this small and unstable kingdom, Babur tried to extend his reign. After several failures, Babur was forced to set his sights on India which had been invaded in earlier centuries by his famous ancestors, Timur and Genghis Khan. 
<br><br>
After the Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur's reign of the new Mughal Empire began - although he only ruled for four short years.
