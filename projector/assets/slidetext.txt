carousel1_text_1=<font face="Arial" size="14"><B>Fireworks</B>: The Mughals had many different ways of keeping themselves entertained, and some of their pastimes doubled as rehearsals for more serious activities.Gunpowder for example, was not just used for warfare, but was enjoyed socially in dramatic firework displays. </font face>
&carousel1_text_2=<font face="Arial" size="14"><B>Archery</B>: The Mughals were expert <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/archer.html', 'arch')"><u>archers</u></a></font>. It was usual to learn to ride and shoot with a bow and arrow from  an early age. To have good archery skills was considered very <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/prestigious.html', 'pres')"><u>prestigious</u></a></font>, so contests and target practice kept standards high and meant that the Mughals were always well-rehearsed for combat.</font face>
&carousel1_text_3=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Hunting</B>:  Hundreds of Mughal paintings boldly illustrate the Mughals' most loved sport - hunting. Emperors <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/akbar.html', 'akba')"><u>Akbar</u></a></font> and <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/j/jahangir.html', 'jaha')"><u>Jahangir</u></a></font> were particularly athletic and loved to go hunting, often with specially trained cheetahs. Deer, tigers and other beasts were driven into an <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/e/enclosure.html', 'encl')"><u>enclosure</u></a></font> at which point the emperor arrived, usually with a bow or sword, rather than a firearm.</font face>
&carousel1_text_4=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Falconry</B>: Although <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/f/falconry.html', 'falc')"><u>falconry</u></a></font> was an early form of hunting, it later developed into a sport. Falconry was thought of as a noble art by the Mughals, and the falconer was seen as a figure of authority, representing high birth and luxury. This falcon perch shows just how valued the birds were; crafted in wood and beautifully decorated in gold and steel. </font face>
&carousel1_text_5=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Tumbling Pigeons</B>: The Mughal emperors kept specially trained pigeons which could tumble in the air. These "tumbler" pigeons could perform as many as twenty backward somersaults in mid flight.</font face>
&carousel1_text_6=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Chess</B>:  Now world-famous, it is believed that the popular game of chess <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/o/originated.html', 'orig')"><u>originated</u></a></font> in India. In strict Islamic circles however, chess was sometimes frowned upon in case it encouraged gambling. Chess was always a game for the educated and wealthy members of society.</font face>
&carousel1_text_7=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Polo</B>: Known as 'The Sport of Kings,' <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/polo.html', 'polo')"><u>polo</u></a></font> is believed to be the oldest team game in the world. First played by <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/n/nomadic.html', 'noma')"><u>nomadic</u></a></font> warriors in India over 2000 years ago, polo became the favourite sport of the British <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/r/raj.html', 'raj')"><u>Raj</u></a></font> in the nineteenth century. <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/akbar.html', 'akba')"><u>Akbar's</u></a></font> polo stables can still be seen in <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/agra.html', 'agra')"><u>Agra</u></a></font> today. </font face>
&carousel1_text_8=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Pachisi</B>: The game <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/pachisi.html', 'pach')"><u>Pachisi</u></a></font> appeared in India several centuries ago, and spread to other parts of Asia, Europe and Africa. You may have played the English, nineteenth century adaptation of Pachisi called <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/ludo.html', 'ludo')"><u>Ludo</u></a></font>. Both games use a cross-shaped board, and involve two teams of two people. </font face>
&carousel1_text_9=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Gardens</B>: The Mughals thought gardens were very important because they came to represent the <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/islamic.html', 'isla')"><u>Islamic</u></a></font> idea of paradise. Most popular were <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/charbagh.html', 'char')"><u>charbagh</u></a></font> gardens which were designed in four parts with a water feature at the centre. The number four represents the four corners of the world and is thought of as <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/prestigious.html', 'pres')"><u>prestigious</u></a></font> in Islam. </font face>
&carousel1_text_10=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Dancing</B>: Dancing was as popular in the courts of the Mughal emperors as it is now. It is interesting to note however, that women often look very similar in Mughal paintings - unlike the portraits of the men which are clearly closely studied portraits. Because the women were rarely seen in public but stayed in the <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/h/harem.html', 'hare')"><u>harem</u></a></font> instead, portraits of them are general, their faces imagined by the artists.  </font face>
&carousel1_text_11=<font face="Times New Roman" size="12"><B>Music</B>: The Mughal courts buzzed with artistic activity. The emperors employed artists, poets, dancers and musicians for their entertainment. Here is a portrait of a famous court musician, standing ready to play his veena, an Indian, seven-stringed instrument.</font face>
&carousel2_text_1=<font face="Arial" size="14"><B>Jewellery</B>: The Mughal emperors and their families were passionate about jewels. Their portraits show them dripping with diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls. They preferred to wear their wealth as a visual display of their power and status. Here Emperor Jahangir's high rank is reflected in the splendour of his turban ornament. </font face>
&carousel2_text_2=<font face="Arial" size="14">Here Emperor Shah Jahan looks confident <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/b/bedecked.html', 'bede')"><u>bedecked</u></a></font> in all his riches. The strand of pearls, rubies and emeralds around his neck is called a 'mala.' The enormous emerald pendant he is wearing may be a 'ta'wiz,' which is an <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/amulet.html', 'amul')"><u>amulet</u></a></font> inscribed with a religious extract from the Qur'an. </font face>
&carousel2_text_3=<font face="Arial" size="14">The Mughals also brought their passion for sparkling riches to even the most ordinary objects such as this bowl made of <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/r/rockcrystal.html', 'rock')"><u>rock crystal</u></a></font>. It has been delicately carved with flowers and decorated with gold </font face>
&carousel2_text_4=<font face="Arial" size="14">Even practical objects such as this archer's thumb-ring would have been highly decorated for a member of the Mughal <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/e/elite.html', 'elit')"><u>elite</u></a></font>. Made of bone, this ring is <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/inset.html', 'inse')"><u>inset</u></a></font> with different gems such as rubies and emeralds. Although a beautiful object, the thumb-ring was designed to protect the wearer from painful friction from the bow-string. </font face>
&carousel2_text_5=<font face="Arial" size="14">This archer's thumb-ring is made of jade and is inlaid with rubies and gold. The pointed side of the ring would have been worn angled down towards the thumbnail. Despite being designed for practical use, archers' rings were also worn as decorative jewellery. We know this because similar thumb-rings can be seen in Mughal paintings. </font face>
&carousel2_text_6=<font face="Arial" size="10">This rock crystal hinged <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/t/trinket.html', 'trin')"><u>trinket</u></a></font> basket, is particularly beautiful. The cut glass is inlaid mainly with rubies, by means of a method called the 'kundun' technique. This technique meant that jewellers could set jewels in soft gold, which would then harden, holding the gems securely in place.  </font face>
&carousel2_text_7=<font face="Arial" size="12">Both men and women in the Mughal court would have worn jewellery such as this nose-ring. At four centimetres across and decorated with rubies, emeralds and seed pearls, it is an impressive piece of decoration. If a pearl was not a good enough shape to be made into jewellery, the Mughals ground them down and drank them as medicine.  </font face>
&carousel2_text_8=<font face="Arial" size="14">Jade was a particularly popular material, not just because of its beautiful, milky-green colours but because it is durable, meaning hard wearing. Jade was also highly prized by the Mughals and other central Asian peoples, because it was believed to have special powers. It was used as a good luck charm against poison for example.</font face>
&carousel2_text_9=<font face="Arial" size="14">This gold pendant has a large diamond set in the centre. Can you see how the diamond represents the breast of a bird whose emerald-green wings are spread wide on either side? It is thought that the Mughals were particularly fond of emeralds because green was the Prophet <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/muhammad.html', 'muha')"><u>Muhammed's</u></a></font>favourite colour.</font face>
&carousel2_text_10=<font face="Arial" size="14">Many Mughal objects took nature as its design source, like this jade cup shaped with leaves and <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/t/tendrils.html', 'tend')"><u>tendrils</u></a></font>. Not only was jade believed to cancel out the effects of poison, but it was also thought to be a good luck charm for gaining victory over enemies.</font face>
&carousel2_text_11=<font face="Arial" size="14">This <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/cameo.html', 'came')"><u>cameo</u></a></font> broach shows a woman in profile and is made of agate. The stone has been carved in a way that takes advantage of the different, naturally occurring colours. The detail is such that you can see the style of her dress, called a <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/sari.html', 'sari')"><u>sari</u></a></font>.</font face>
&carousel2_text_12=<font face="Arial" size="14">This beautiful, horse-headed dagger would not just have been worn for decoration, but would have been used in war. The blade is made of damascened steel which broadly means that the metal has been decorated in some way. Here, a flower <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/motif.html', 'moti')"><u>motif</u></a></font> has been <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/e/etched.html', 'etch')"><u>etched</u></a></font> into its surface.</font face>
&carousel2_text_13=<font face="Arial" size="14">You can often see emperors in paintings wearing armbands such as this. Armbands were fixed over the outer layer of clothing and tied with the cords, which in this case, is strung with pearls. </font face>
&carousel2_text_14=<font face="Arial" size="14">As well as being weapons of war, daggers were highly prized items and were given as presents. Those studded with gems and jewels were more commonly given to emperors or given as gifts by them.</font face>
