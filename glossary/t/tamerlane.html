<!--ENTER GLOSSARY TEXT BELOW-->
Timur was known as Timur the Lame because of injuries he received in battle. Over time, the English changed his name to Tamerlane. 
<br><br>
Born in 1336 near Samarkand, Timur was a Mongol leader. He led devasting wars all over Persia and conquered vast areas, but died while marching to conquer China. 
<br><br>
Timur's capital Samarkand was famous for its fabulous architecture. Babur, the first Mughal emperor, took inspiration from Timur who was his relation. He longed to create buildings as splendid as those in Samarkand.
