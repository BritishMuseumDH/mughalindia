&a1_punishment_pg1=<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India.</b><br><br>The wretched prisoner was therefore secured on an elephant; his young son, Sepe-Chekouh, placed at his side, and behind them, instead of the executioner, was seated Bhadur-Kan. This was not one of the majestic elephants of Pegu or Ceylon, which Dara had been in the habit of mounting, pompously caparisoned, the harness gilt, and trappings decorated with figured work; and carrying a beautifully painted howdah, inlaid with gold, and a magnificent canopy to shelter the Prince form the sun: Dara was now seen seated on a miserable and worn-out animal, covered with filth; he no longer wore the necklace of large pearls which distinguish the princes of Hindoustan, nor the rich turban and embroidered coat; he and his son were now habited in dirty cloth of the coarsest texture, and his sorry turban was wrapt round with a Kachemire shawl or scarf, resembling that worn by the meanest of the people. <br><br>	Such was the appearance of Dara when led through the Bazars and every quarter of the city.</font>

&a2_punishment_pg1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India.</b><br><br>The wretched prisoner, Dara, was tied to an elephant along with his young son, Sepe-Chekouh, with Bahdur-Kan, behind them. Unlike the impressive elephants the royal Dara was used to riding, this elephant did not have any gold trappings or harness, and no beautiful howdah to sit in. Instead the elephant was a filthy, miserable, worn-out old beast, covered in muck. Stripped of their royal clothes and jewellery, Dara and his son were forced to wear rags, like those worn only by the poorest people.<br><br>Such was the humiliating appearance of Dara when he was led through the city.</font>

At this place they brought to show me a piebald animal, like the flying (i.e. jumping) mouse, which in the Hindi tongue they call <i>galahri</i> (squirrel), and said that mice would not frequent any house in which this animal was. On this account they call this animal the master of mice. As I had never seen one before, I ordered my painters to draw a likeness of it. </font>

&h1_incident_pg1=<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="11"><b>A report from Jean Baptiste Tavernier, a respected Frenchman who travelled in India and Persia between 1651 and 1658. </b><br><br>One day when Shah Jahan was out hunting upon his elephant with one of his sons, who sat with him in order to fan him, the elephant became so much in heat that the driver, not being able to control it any longer, told the King that in order to arrest the rage of the elephant, which might crush them among the trees, it was necessary that one of the three who was on the elephant would offer himself up, and that with all his heart he sacrificed his life for the King and his son, begging his majesty to take care of the three children whom he was leaving. Having said so, he threw himself under the elephant, and immediately the animal took him with his trunk, and having crushed him under his feet, became mild and tractable as before. The King, for this wonderful escape, gave 200,000 rupees to the poor, and promoted at court each of the sons of the man who had so generously given his life for the safely to his Prince. </font>

The elephant driver warned the King that he could not control the stampeding animal any longer, and that the only way to stop the animal's rage, was for one of them to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the other two. The driver was willing to give his life to save the King and his son, but first asked if in return, the King would take care of his three children. He then threw himself under the elephant, which grabbed him with his trunk, and trampled him. Having killed the man, the elephant was immediately calm. In gratitude to this rescue, Shah Jahan gave 200, 000 rupees to the poor, and promoted the sons of the man who had so generously given his life to save them. </font>

Immediately in the rear of the cannon, he ranged a line of light camels, on the forepart of whose bodies' small pieces of ordnance, somewhat resembling swivels in our vessels, were fixed: these the rider could charge and discharge at pleasure, without being obliged to dismount. Behind these camels was posted the most considerable part of the musketeers. </font>

Behind the cannon, he stood a line of camels with swivel-guns fixed to the front of their bodies. This meant that the camel-rider could fire the guns at will, without having to get off the camel. Behind the row of camels were most of the musketeers.</font>
