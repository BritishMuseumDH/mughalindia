<!--ENTER GLOSSARY TEXT BELOW-->
Shah Jahan became the fifth Mughal emperor when he came to the throne in 1628. He was most famous for his passion for jewels and architecture and had the spectacular Taj Mahal built when his much-loved wife died. 
<br><br>
Although the empire was at its height during his reign, its resources were stretched and soon the financial cracks began to show. 
<br><br>
Towards the end of his reign, Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb was impatient for power, and took over the throne in 1658. Shah Jahan was placed under house arrest until he died in 1666.
