&a1_western_pg1=<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India.</b><br><br>I have often admired beauty, softness, and delicacy of their paintings and miniatures, and was particularly struck with the exploits of Ekbar, painted on a shield by a celebrated artist, who was said to have been seven years in completing the picture. I thought it a wonderful performance. The Indian painters are chiefly deficient in just proportions, and in the expression of the face; but these defects would soon be corrected if they possessed good masters, and were instructed in the rules of art. <br><br>Want of genius, therefore, is not the reason why works of superior art are not exhibited in the capital. If the artists and manufacturers were encouraged, the useful and fine arts would flourish' but these unhappy men are contemned, treated with harshness, and inadequately remunerated for their labour. The rich will have every article at a cheap rate.</font>

Their sizes, dimensions and facial expressions are all wrong. It is not that the Indian artists cannot draw, or have no talent at art - it is simply that they do not have good art teachers to train them properly. To make things worse, artists are treated badly and paid low wages, which discourages them.</font>

He painted extremely delicately, but he made the faces of beardless people badly by drawing the double chin too big.

&c_islam_pg1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>Extract from a modern novel, by Orhan Pamuk.</b><br><br>"Why did they all believe that painting would bar them from the gates of Heaven?"<br><br>"You know quite well why! Because they remembered Our Prophet's warning that on Judgement Day, Allah will punish painters most severely."<br><br>"Not painters," corrected Enishte Effendi. "Those who make idols. And this not from the Koran bur from Bukhari."<br><br>"On Judgement Day, the idol makers will be asked to bring the images they've created to life," I said cautiously. "Since they'll be unable to do so their lot will be to suffer the torments of Hell. Let it not be forgotten that in the Glorious Koran, 'creator' is one of the attributes of Allah. It is Allah who is creative, who brings that which is not into existence, who gives life to the lifeless. No one ought to compete with Him. (...)</font>

&c_islam_pg2=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11">"Do you think this is what we've been doing?"<br><br> "Never," I said with a smile. "However, this is what Elegant Effendi, may he rest in peace, began to assume when he saw the last painting. He'd been saying that your use of the science of perspective and the methods of the Venetian masters was nothing but the temptation of Satan. In the last painting, you've supposedly rendered the face of a mortal using the Frankish techniques, so the observer has the impression not of a painting but of reality; to such a degree that this image has the power to entice men to bow down before it, as with icons in churches. According to him, this is the Devil's work, not only because the art of perspective removes the painting from God's perspective and lowers it to the level of a street dog, but because your reliance on the methods of the Venetians as well as your mingling of our own established traditions with that of the infidels will strip us of our purity and reduce us to being their slaves."</font>

At this place they brought to show me a piebald animal, like the flying (i.e. jumping) mouse, which in the Hindi tongue they call <i>galahri</i> (squirrel), and said that mice would not frequent any house in which this animal was. On this account they call this animal the master of mice. As I had never seen one before, I ordered my painters to draw a likeness of it.</font>
