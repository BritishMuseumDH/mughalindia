&introduction=Whereas the western calendar usually gives dates as AD or BC, the letters AH indicate that the Islamic calendar is in use. 
The Islamic calendar began in AD 622 when the prophet Muhammad fled from Mecca to Medina. 
Also, because the Islamic calendar is based on the lunar year, it is shorter than the western solar calendar year. That means at least 622 years must be subtracted from an Islamic date to get a rough idea of the western equivalent.
