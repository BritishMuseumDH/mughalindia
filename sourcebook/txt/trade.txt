The presents consisted of a quantity of very fine broad cloths, scarlet and green; some large looking-glasses; and several articles of Chinese and Japan workmanship; among which were a <i>paleky</i> and a <i>Tack-ravan</i>, or travelling throne, of exquisite beauty and much admired.<br><br>The Great Mogol is in the habit of detaining all ambassadors as long as can reasonably be done, from an idea that it is becoming his grandeur and power, to receive the homage of foreigners, and to number them among the attendants of his court. Monsieur Adrican was not dismissed, therefore, so expeditiously as he wished, though much sooner than the ambassadors of Tartary. </font>

Aurangzeb gave out very finely woven, brocade suits, whilst he received a variety of gifts including red and green cloth, large mirrors, and some Chinese and Japanese articles. Amongst these was a very beautiful travelling throne called a Tack-ravan. <br><br>Aurangzeb likes to keep ambassadors of other countries in his court for as long as possible, because he thinks it is flattering and appropriate for someone of his status. Therefore, Monsieur Adrican was not dismissed as quickly as he would have liked, but sooner than the ambassadors of Tartar.

It turned out just as he foresaw. </font>

&b2_ambas2_pg1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India.</b><br><br>Aurangzeb presented both ambassadors with fabulous clothes, and ordered that the two Ethiopians should be well looked after. He also gave them six thousand rupees between them but this was not equally shared. He gave the Muslim ambassador six thousand rupees, but because Murat was a Christian, he only gave him two thousand rupees. <br><br>Aurangzeb also gave them gifts for their King, including rich clothes, two silver and gold trumpets, two kettle-drums, a ruby-encrusted dagger, and money. He explained that the coins were a special gift because he knew that the Ethiopians did not mint coins in their own country. However, quietly, Aurangzeb knew that this money would be spent in his own country - and that is exactly what the ambassadors did!</font>

There are also many parts of the Indies, where the population is sufficiently abundant, and the land pretty well tilled; and where the artisan, although naturally indolent, is yet compelled by necessity or otherwise to employ himself in manufacturing carpets, brocades, embroideries, gold and silver cloths, and the various sorts of silk and cotton goods, which are used in the country or exported abroad.

The soil of Bengal is even richer than Egypt's for growing rice and corn. However, Bengal produces a greater variety of goods than Egypt, goods such as silk, cotton and indigo. Other, highly populated areas of India also have good, fertile land. Although the workers are naturally lazy, they still have to work to make a living. They make carpets, woven fabrics, embroideries, gold and silver cloths and silk and cotton goods. These are used in the country or sold abroad. </font>

This being very disagreeable to my mind, I despatched Muqarrab Khan who is in charge of the port, on the 18th Azar, giving him a horse and elephant and a dress of honour, to obtain compensation for this affair.</font>
