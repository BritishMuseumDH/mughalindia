&txt1=The artists of the Mughal court produced luxuriously illustrated stories, manuscripts and albums. The workshops they worked in were called kitab-khana which means 'house of books'. 
The techniques they used were painstakingly detailed, and the materials very expensive - but the results were well worth their costly efforts. Here an artist (Anita Chowdry) reproduces a corner of a miniature painting using the techniques <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/laboriously.html','labo')">laboriously</a></font></u> followed by the Mughal court artists.
&txt2=Before an artist can apply a single brushstroke, the paper must first be burnished. This polishing is done by hand with a burnisher, a glassy stone set in a wooden block.
&txt3=Artists often reused designs by tracing pictures onto sheets of thin deer skin. Another studio practice was 'pouncing,' where the lines of a tracing would be pierced with tiny pinpricks. This stencil would then be placed over a new sheet of paper and dusted with fine red or yellow <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/o/ochre.html','ochr')">ochre</a></font></u>, leaving a faint dotted outline.
&txt4=Either free-hand or using a traced design, an artist would then complete the drawing for their painting. Instead of pencils, very fine brushes made of squirrel hair were used. This initial sketch was known as the tarh.
&txt5=After the initial drawing is completed, the artist then fills in the design with blocks of colour. The more precious a pigment was, such as lapis lazuli or malachite, the more unlikely it was to be mixed with other colours or agents. However, with their growing interest in European painting, the Mughals experimented with colour mixing in an attempt to recreate some of their atmospheric effects.
&txt6=It is when all the colours have been blocked in that the artist's most specialised skills come into play. With very delicate, tiny brush strokes, layers of detail are added to the painting. 
&txt7=Between each stage of colouring, the artist repeatedly <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/b/burnish.html','burn')">burnishes</a></font></u> the painting. This seals the colour to the paper and gives a gleam to the surface. It is this process that gives Mughal paintings their famous jewel-like appearance.
&txt8=It is only at the last stages that gold details are added. Pure gold is scraped into a shell and mixed by hand with water and a little <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/g/gumarabic.html','guma')">gum arabic</a></font></u> until a slick paint is formed. When the gold is first used it is dull and <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/matt.html','matt')">matt</a></font></u>, and does not really look like gold at all.
&txt9=Only when the gold is <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/b/burnish.html','burn')">burnished</a></font></u> with a smooth gemstone, does its true, glossy shine come through. The artist first wipes the gemstone over their nose, making use of the natural oils there which help the burnishing process.
&txt10=The final stage of the painting is the defining. This is when the artist uses subtle outlines to pick out the fine details and to add any last touches.
&txt11=When the artist is satisfied with the end result, the whole painting is burnished to a jewel-like sheen that brings out all the colour and brilliance of the artwork.

&extra2=Artists would have their own, preferred burnisher that fitted snugly into the palm of their hand. The paper would be repeatedly rubbed until it shone.
&extra3=Rather than sitting for hours for numerous artists, emperors would have official portraits of themselves approved. These were then reproduced in different paintings using the pouncing technique. This technique was also used in Medieval England, particularly in the portraits of Elizabeth I.
&extra4=A black colour called lamp black was used in Mughal drawings. Lamp black was made from the soot created from burning oil. It was also used as kohl, a form of eye makeup for women.
&extra5=Mughal artists prepared most of their own colours themselves. Colours were made up of natural materials such as ground gemstone, minerals, clay or even cow urine! These pure <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/pigment.html','pigm')">pigment</a></font></u> powders were then mixed with water and <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/g/gumarabic.html','guma')">gum arabic</a></font></u> so that they could be painted with. Because many minerals used were toxic, pigment mixtures could lead to chemical reactions. Indeed, the art of pigment making was really more of a science, an early form of chemistry.
&extra6=One technique used by <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/v/virtuoso.html','virt')">virtuoso</a></font></u> Mughal artists is called phardaz. This is a Persian word meaning feathery or <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/stippled.html','stip')">stippled</a></font></u>. Often beards, moustaches and feathers are done using this very detailed technique.
&extra7=The artist here is painting a simurgh a monstrous bird from Persian mythology, a little like a dragon but closer to the <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/phoenix.html','phoe')">phoenix</a></font></u>. The simurgh has the powers of reasoning and speech.
&extra8=Most colours were prepared by artists themselves, usually by grinding the raw material such as <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/malachite.html','mala')">malachite</a></font></u> into a fine powder. However, some more complex <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/pigment.html','pigm')">pigments</a></font></u> including gold, were produced by specialists whose job was to make these highly prized colours.
&extra9=As well as gold, the Mughals used pure silver in their paintings, but over time this has <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/t/tarnished.html','tarn')">tarnished</a></font></u>, and grown to look black and dull.

&extra11=The entire Mughal painting process from start to finish would take many hours, many different skills and often more than one artist. A <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/h/hierarchy.html','hier')">hierarchy</a></font></u> existed within the court <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/atelier.html','atel')">ateliers</a></font></u> - those at the bottom of the scale would do the <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/menial.html','meni')">menial</a></font></u> tasks such as grinding pigments and mixing paints. More established artists would design original <u><font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/composition.html','comp')">compositions</a></font></u> and do the more delicate, detailed paintwork.
