<!--ENTER GLOSSARY TEXT BELOW-->
The sepoys of the Sepoy Rebellion were native Indian soldiers under British discipline in the 19th Century. 
<br><br>
The Mughal Empire had slowly lost power to the British over the decades although there still officially was a Mughal emperor called Bahadur Shah II. In 1857, Bahadur Shah was called upon by the sepoys to be the figurehead for an uprising against British rule. 
<br><br>
However, the British crushed the rebellion, and Bahadur Shah was accused of treason. Effectively the Sepoy Rebellion, which is sometimes known as India's first war of Independence, led to the end of the Mughal Empire.
