obj11=<b>Bows and arrows</b><br><br>An archer could choose from at least twenty different arrow styles, according to what result he or she wanted. A very fine-pointed arrowhead could pierce through the small links of mail armour. A blunt arrowhead could knock a bird out of the air without leaving it too mangled to make a good meal! <BR><BR>The feathers at the end of arrows are called 'flights' and keep the arrow from spinning off course. The flights could direct a flat arrow blade to travel at a chosen angle - perhaps horizontally to slice through the small gaps between the human ribcage, or vertically through an animal's ribcage.
