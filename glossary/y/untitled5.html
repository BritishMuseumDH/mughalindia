Also known as the Sepoy Rebellion, the Sepoy Mutiny and India's First War of Independence, the Indian Mutiny marked an important political event in Indian history. In 1857 sepoys, who were native Indian soldiers under British rule, organised a violent uprising against the British. They looked to the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah II as their true ruler to lead the uprising, but their efforts were crushed by the British. It was this defeat that finished the Mughal Empire once and for all, and the last of the emperors was exiled to Burma. </td></tr>
