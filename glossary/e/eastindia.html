<!--ENTER GLOSSARY TEXT BELOW-->
The English East India Company was a large group of merchants who had recognized the vast opportunites for trade and wealth in India. 
<br><br>
After gaining the authority of a royal charter from Queen Elizabeth I in 1600, trade in spices and other goods began in earnest. Warehouses known as factories were built around India and the Company increased in wealth, influence and power. 
<br><br>
However, by 1783 the East India Company was effectively in the hands of the British government, as was the majority of India. The Mughal Empire was no more than a name. 
<br><br>
The East India Company was finally abolished in 1858.
