<!--ENTER GLOSSARY TEXT BELOW-->

Reigning from 1658, Aurangzeb was the last of the six great Mughal emperors, although there were many less powerful emperors after him. 
<br><br>
Aurangzeb was a serious-minded man and a strict Muslim who was keen to reintroduce Islamic law and values to his diverse empire. During his reign, the Mughal Empire was at its largest, but political and religious troubles were breaking out everywhere and the sprawling size of the kingdom led to financial problems.
<br><br>
 At Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughal Empire was on the brink of decline.
