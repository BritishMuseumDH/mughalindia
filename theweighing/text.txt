introduction=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Birthday celebrations</b> <BR><BR>Not content with a simple party, the ruling Mughals since <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/akbar.html', 'akba')"><u>Akbar</u></a></font> had a tradition of weighing either the emperor or one of his sons at the start of the <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/l/lunaryear.html', 'luny')"><u>lunar</u></a></font> and <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/solaryear.html', 'sola')"><u>solar years</u></a></font>.

&object_1=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Title</b> <BR><BR>This line of Persian script acts like a caption under a newspaper photograph.<br><br>It summarizes the painting's meaning with an extract from <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/j/jahangir.html', 'jaha')"><u>Jahangir's</u></a></font> diary describing his son's 15th birthday celebrations. It tells us, "The whole day was passed in enjoyment and pleasure in the house of Baba Khurram, and many of his presents were approved." </font face>

&object_2=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Weighing scale</b><br><br>This enormous weighing scale, which looks rather like an extravagant swing, is made of gold and is studded with rubies and precious jewels.<br><br>The fifteen year-old Prince Khurram (who later became Emperor Shah Jahan) sits on one side of the scale, whilst his equivalent weight in gold and silver is measured on the opposite side. These treasures will later be distributed to the poor in honour of his birthday. </font face>

These were then distributed to the needy.<br><br>Jahangir wrote specifically about this event in his diary, so historians know that this ceremony happened on the 6th of Rabi II 1016, which is the <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/i/islamiccal.html', 'isla')"><u>Islamic calendar</u></a></font> equivalent to the 31st of July 1607 A.D.</font face> 

&object_4=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Prince Khurram</b><br><br>This is Prince Khurram on his fifteenth birthday, who later became Emperor Shah Jahan.<br><br>Spread out in front of him is an impressive display of very expensive and luxurious birthday presents. The Prince's father, Emperor <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/j/jahangir.html', 'jaha')"><u>Jahangir</u></a></font>, holds the swing-like scales steady - as perhaps his father <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/akbar.html', 'akba')"><u>Akbar</u></a></font>, did before him.<br><br>It was Akbar who started the weighing ceremony tradition. </font face>

&object_5=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Earrings</b><br><br>Jahangir's earrings illustrate his wealth, but they also have a story behind them. In 1614 Jahangir recovered from a serious illness. He put his recovery down to the Chishtiyya order of <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/d/dervishes.html', 'derv')"><u>dervishes</u></a></font>, religious men who had <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/d/dedicatedly.html', 'dedi')"><u>dedicatedly</u></a></font> prayed for his health. <br><br>Jahangir showed his gratitude and <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/a/allegiance.html', 'alle')"><u>allegiance</u></a></font> to the order, by wearing the earrings. </font face>

&object_6=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Valuable gifts</b><br><br>Here you can see trays of fine material and other presents wrapped in richly embroidered cloth.<br><br>Those nearest the Prince, namely the daggers and the jewellery, are the most valuable.<br><br>This is not simply a mound of birthday presents for the young prince, but also a visual display of the empire's wealth and success. </font face>

They believed that jade had special qualities that could <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/c/counteract.html', 'coun')"><u>counteract</u></a></font> poison and bring good luck. </font face>

&object_8=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Treasures of crystal</b><br><br>These alcoves are displaying some of the Emperor Jahangir's collected treasures.

&object_10=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Imported treasures</b><br><br>These alcoves are displaying some of the Emperor Jahangir's collected treasures.<br><br>It's difficult to tell, but these figurines could be early Chinese imports. These highly sought-after items tell us of the Mughal Empire's great wealth, but also shed light on who the Mughals were trading with and at what time. </font face>

&object_11=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Knives and daggers</b><br><br>Here is a tray of knives and daggers meant as gifts for the young prince. They are studded with rubies, emeralds and diamonds, with handles of jade and precious metals.<br><br>Even though these daggers look highly decorative, they were for practical use and would have been taken into battle and on hunts.<br><br>The Mughals adored precious stones, and believed them to have positive effects, protecting the wearer from evil and bringing them good fortune. </font face>

&object_12=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Jewellery</b><br><br>The Mughals were famous for their enormous wealth, which they displayed most effectively in the magnificent jewels they drenched themselves in.<br><br>Here we can see a tray of jewellery for the young prince, including necklaces, broaches and turban ornaments. These were particularly telling, because a turban ornament could tell an envious onlooker what rank the wearer was. </font face>

&object_13=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Gold vessels</b><br><br>This tray displays small gold jars, bowls, cups and saucers.<br><br>The Mughals took great delight in displaying their wealth, not just in special items such as jewellery, but in everyday items too.<br><br>These various <font color='#990000'><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/v/vessel.html', 'vess')"><u>vessels</u></a></font> are all gorgeously decorated with precious stones and jewels, and would have certainly won the Prince's approval on his birthday. </font face>

&object_15=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Halos</b><br><br>You may be able to see circles of light around Prince Khurram's and Emperor Jahangir's heads.

&object_16=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Generals</b><br><br>Generals of high rank enjoy front-row seats at the special weighing ceremony of Prince Khurram. <br><br>The generals' names can be seen written on items of their clothing.

&object_19=<font face="Arial" size="12"><b>Bags of coins</b><br><br>These bags of coins have been added to the scale until they equalled the weight of Prince Khurram. Unlike all the Prince's gifts displayed on the floor, the contents of these bags will later be distributed to the needy.<br><br>The Mughals saw generosity as an important part of their reign, because it was seen as a sign of their wealth, success and power. </font face>
