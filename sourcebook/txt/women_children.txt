&a1_dara_pg1=<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India. </b><br><br>I had now been three days with Dara, whom I met on the road by the strangest chance imaginable; and being destitute of any medical attendant, he compelled me to accompany him in the capacity of physician. The day preceding that on which he received the Governor's communication, he expressed his fear lest I should be murdered by the <i>Koullys</i>, and insisted upon my passing the night in the <i>Karavanserrak</i>, where he then was. The cords of the <i>kanates</i>, or screens, which concealed his wife and women (for he was without even a tent) were fastened to the wheels of the carriage, wherein I reposed. This may appear almost incredible to those who know how extremely jealous the great men of <i>Hindoustan</i> are of their wives, and I mention the circumstance as a proof of the low condition to which the fortunes of the Prince were reduced.</font>

&a1_dara_pg2=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India.</b><br><br>I had met Dara by chance on the road, and had been with him for three days. He did not have anyone with him with medical knowledge, so he asked me to join him as his doctor. He was also concerned that I might be murdered by the Koullys, so insisted that I join him in his Karavanserrak. The cords of the screens which hid his wife and other women from sight were tied to the wheels of my carriage. Normally, the great men of India would be very protective of their women. This was proof of how desperate Dara's situation had become.</font>

This is the son, whom, it is supposed, he intends for his successor, and such an alliance would strengthen Ekbar's authority and ensure his right to the throne. [...] But <i>Aurang-Zebe</i> was frustrated in his intention. <i>Shah-Jehan</i> and <i>Begum-Saheb</i> rejected the proposition with disdain, and the young Princess herself manifested the utmost repugnance to the marriage. She remained inconsolable during many days form an apprehension that she might be forcibly taken away, declaring it was her firm purpose to die by her own hand, rather than be united to the son of him who murdered her father. </font>

&b2_aurang_pg1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India.</b><br><br>As soon as Aurangzeb was better again, he tried to take Dara's daughter from Shah Jahan and Begum-Saheb because he wanted her to marry his own son, Sultan Ekbar. Aurangzeb wanted Sultan Ekbar to become emperor after him. By marrying Dara's daughter, Sultan Ekbar's right to the throne would be even stronger. <br><br>However, Aurangzeb's plans were blocked. Shah Jahan and Begum-Saheb strongly rejected the plan, and the princess herself hated the thought of marrying Ekbar. She was terrified she might be taken away and forced to marry against her wishes. The princess declared that she would rather kill herself, than marry the son of Aurangzeb, the man who was responsible for killing her father.

After the performance of obeisance and prostration and greeting which is due from the young to the old according to the custom of Chingiz, the rules of Timur and common usage, and after worship of the King of the World (God), and after finishing this business, I obtained leave to return, and re-entered Lahore. </font>

I greeted her in the respectful way that young people traditionally greet their elders - as has been the custom of our ancestors including Genghis Khan and Timur.

&h1_education_pg1=<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India. </b><br><br>Aureng-Zebe assembled his privy-council, together with the learned men of his court, for the purpose of selecting a suitable preceptor for his third son, Sultan Ekbar, whom he designs for his successor. He evinced upon this occasion the utmost solicitude that the young Prince should receive such an education as might justify the hope of his becoming a great man. No person can be more alive than Aureng-Zebe to the necessity of storing the minds of Princes, destined to rule nations, with useful knowledge. As they surpass others in power and elevation, so ought they, he says, to be pre-eminent in wisdom and virtue. He is very sensible that the cause of the misery which afflicts the empires of Asia ... will be found, in the deficient and pernicious mode of instructing the children of their Kings. Intrusted from infancy to the care of women and eunuchs or slaves ... whose minds are debased by the very nature of their occupation; servile and mean to superiors, proud and oppressive to dependants; - these Princes, when called to the throne, leave the walls of the Seraglio quite ignorant of the duties imposed upon them by their new situation. </font>

&h1_education_pg2=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>A report from Francoise Bernier, a 17th century French doctor who travelled in India. </b><br><br>Emperor Aurangzeb wanted to choose a suitable teacher for his son, Sultan Ekbar, whom he hoped would be Emperor after him. Aurangzeb got together important and educated people from his court, and stressed his wishes for an education that would well prepare his son for the role of emperor. If an emperor has more power and status than other people, so he says, then they must be top also in wisdom and respectability. Aurangzeb believes that the weaknesses of the empires of Asia, can be blamed on the poor education of those children who grow up to rule. These princes are brought up by women, eunuchs and slaves who themselves can set no good example, because they are not well educated and are dependent on others. With these low-class people as their teachers, princes cannot cope with the demands and duties of power when they are called to the throne. </font>
