After the initial drawing is completed, the artist then fills in the design with blocks of colour. The more precious a pigment was, such as lapis lazuli or malachite, the more unlikely it was to be mixed with other colours or agents. However, with their growing interest in European painting, the Mughals experimented with colour mixing in an attempt to recreate some of their atmospheric effects.

Mughal artists prepared most of their own colours themselves. Colours were made up of natural materials such as ground gemstone, minerals, clay or even cow urine!  These pure pigment powders were then mixed with water and gum arabic so that they could be painted with. Because many minerals used were toxic, pigment mixtures could lead to chemical reactions. Indeed, the art of pigment making was really more of a science, an early form of chemistry.
