page_1=This large jade terrapin is always a popular object at The British Museum and has an intriguing story to match its appeal.<BR><BR>Found at the bottom of a water cistern during engineering excavations in Allahabad, its use has never been entirely clear. It may have been made for Akbar who reigned between 1556 and 1605, as he built a new palace at the Hindu city of Prag, which he then renamed Allahabad.<BR><BR>Or perhaps the terrapin was commissioned by Akbar's son, crown prince Salim who later became Emperor Jahangir. 

&page_2=The terrapin is made of solid jade, which is an extremely hard stone and cannot be carved. Instead it has to be abraded, which means scraped and worn into shape using materials such as sand-paper.<BR><BR>It is because jade is so difficult to work with that makes the terrapin particularly special. The model is so accurate in its detail, that it has been possible to identify the exact species of terrapin as the three-striped roof turtle (Kachuga dhongaka).<BR><BR>This particular river turtle is found in the Yamuna River.

&page_3=Not only do objects in museums tell us a lot about history, but so too do the museums themselves.<BR><BR>Why were certain objects chosen for collection and display above others?<BR><BR>How were they presented and interpreted?<BR><BR>What did the collectors think about those people, cultures and civilizations from whom they took or bought objects?<BR><BR>Has our understanding changed over the years? 

&page_3b=When the jade terrapin first arrived in England, it was thought of as interesting simply because it was an enormous lump of jade. As a result, it was displayed in 1857 in what was then the Mineral collection - a collection which moved to the Natural History museum during the1880s.<BR><BR>However, the terrapin was kept at The British Museum and enjoyed higher status as an art object in the Department of Asia, where it is today.

&page_4=Here, you can look at the jade terrapin in all its three-dimensional glory, by means of the internet and 360° photography.<BR><BR>In the 1850s however, the public enjoyed a simpler but similar effect through stereoscopic views. These were photographs of the museum's collections which, if looked at through a special viewer, appeared three-dimensional. You may have seen films or comics through similar '3-D' glasses.<BR><BR>Can you see the jade terrapin on its stand in this stereoscopic photograph?
