&a1_akbar_pg1=<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="11"><b>Translating Akbar's memoirs in 1902 - by H. Beveridge.</b><br><br>The task of translation has occupied me several years, and the work has not been very congenial, for Abul Fazl is not an author for whom one can feel much sympathy or admiration. He was a great flatterer and unhesitatingly suppressed or distorted facts. His style, too, seems - at least to Western eyes - to be quite detestable, being full of circumlocutions, and both turgid and obscure. He is often prolix, and often unduly concise and darkly allusive. His one merit - and it is one which he specially claims for himself - is his laboriousness. He was an unwearied worker, and when we blame him and lament his deficiencies we shall do well to consider what a blank our knowledge of Akbar's reign would have been, had not Abul Fazl exerted himself during years of strenuous effort to chronicle events and institutions. His work also has the imperishable merit of being a record by a contemporary, and by one who had access to information at first hand.</font>

&a2_akbar_pg1=<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="11"><b>Translating Akbar's memoirs in 1902 - by H. Beveridge.</b><br><br>It has taken me many years to translate the Akbarnama - a task which has not been easy, largely because the author's style is so difficult and unappealing. Abul Fazl was a great flatterer, putting people in a very good light, and he would often distort facts or ignore them all together. His writing style is difficult for Westerners to take, because it goes round and round in circles. It is also heavy going because it is full of pompous detail, which makes it long, and often tedious to read. However, he can also be too short in his explanations and almost secretive.<br><br>Despite these shortcomings, Abul Fazl was a hard worker and thanks to him, we know a lot about Akbar's reign. It is always a great privilege to have such a detailed account written by someone who was actually there at the time.</font>

When he laughs, his face becomes almost distorted. His expression is tranquil, serene and open, full also of dignity, and when he is angry, of awful majesty ... It is hard to exaggerate how accessible he makes himself to all who wish audience with him.

Her face oblong, fair but wrinkled, her eyes small, yet black and pleasant, her nose a little hooked, her lips narrow and her teeth black (a defect the English seem subject to, from their too great use of sugar). She had in the ears tow pearls with very rich drops. She wore false hair and that red. Upon her head she had a small crown, reputed to be made of some of the gold of the celebrated Luneburg table. Her bosom was uncovered, as all English lades have it till they marry, and she had on a necklace of exceeding fine jewels. Her hands were small, her fingers long and her stature neither tall nor low. Her air was stately, her manner speaking mild and obliging. That day, she was dressed in whites silk, bordered with pearls of the size of beans, and, over it, a mantle of black silk, shot with silver threads. Her train was very long. The end of it borne by a marchioness. Instead of a chain, she had an oblong collar of gold and jewels.</font>
