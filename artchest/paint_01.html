<h3>Painting a Mughal Manuscript Miniature</h3>

The artists of the Mughal court produced luxuriously illustrated stories, manuscripts and albums. The workshops they worked in were called kitab-khana which means 'house of books'.
</p>
<p>
The techniques they used were painstakingly detailed, and the materials very expensive - but the results were well worth their costly efforts. Here an artist (Anita Chowdry) reproduces a corner of a miniature painting using the techniques laboriously followed by the Mughal court artists.
