&txt1=Mughal artists prepared most of their <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/pigment.html','greg')"><u>pigments</u></a></font> themselves. Colours were made up of natural materials such as ground gemstone, minerals, clay or even cow urine! Here we follow the process that takes malachite in its natural form, to a useable paint. 
&txt2=The greenish-blue colour that you can see in most Mughal paintings is actually ground <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/m/malachite.html','greg')"><u>malachite</u></a></font>. To produce this <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/p/pigment.html','greg')"><u>pigments</u></a></font>, an artist would grind a piece of malachite gemstone to a fine powder. The longer the malachite is ground, the paler the colour becomes. After it is ground, the malachite powder is thoroughly washed so that no impurities can spoil the final colour. 
&txt3=The ground malachite is traditionally put into a mussel shell and mixed with a little water with the thumb. The shell does not add anything chemically - simply its smooth surface and shallow basin-like shape makes it a natural tool for the job. 
&txt4=<font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/g/gumarabic.html','guma')"><u>gum arabic</u></a></font> is then added in tiny amounts to bind the malachite <font color="#660000"><a href="javascript:openGlos('glossary/s/solution.html','greg')"><u>solution</u></a></font>. Gum arabic is a natural-forming glue, a resin that seeps from the acacia tree and then hardens. Mughal artists or their assistants, would dissolve this resin and then boil it to create a syrupy liquid. 
&txt5=Here you can see malachite in more than one form: in its natural state, ground into a powder, as paint and fashioned into a necklace.
