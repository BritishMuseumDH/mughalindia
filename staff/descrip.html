	<p>This website presents a museum's 'Students' Room'. Within it you will find a wealth of visual and textual resources: paintings, coins, weapons, jewellery and models from The British Museum's collections. Students are invited to use the room to research an area they are interested in. The more resources they use within the website, the more they will learn about this period.</p>

<p>Certain staples are provided within each room. The timelines on the wall provide a basic chronological framework for the period. An Atlas on the bookshelf provides the geographical information necessary for your study. The filing cabinets provide primary sources which can be used to deepen the student's understanding of the period.</p>

<p>Using the other resources in the room students can build up their knowledge of early Imperial China. Topics covered include war, religion, art and architecture, trade and transport. The room is built in such a way as to encourage students to cross-refer to other relevant areas of the website. </p>
